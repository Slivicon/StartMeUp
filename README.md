# StartMeUp
This mod for Farming Simulator 17 PC allows individual players to toggle the Automatic start and stop of vehicle motors as a player preference, instead of the default single game setting affecting all players, when the game setting for Automatic Motor Start is set to "Off".

It also allows this functionality when the game setting for Automatic Motor Start is disabled, such as when using the "Seasons" mod.

With the game setting for Automatic Motor Start set to "Off", then for example, player A can turn on the Automatic motor start functionality just for player A using a simple key command, as shown in the help menu, which of course can be customized in the game options for key bindings. This would not affect player B, who could choose to leave it off.

It also allows for easily toggling it on and off depending on the activity, without affecting the other players.

Finally, even in a single player game, it may not be possible to turn on the game setting for Automatic Motor Start, such as when using the "Seasons" mod (which disables the setting), but this mod will still allow the functionality while the game setting is disabled and off.
